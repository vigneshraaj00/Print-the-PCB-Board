3. Fix the copper clad board in PCB MATE Machine using Double side tape.
4. Set the spindle in manual mode
5. Move the spindle to the location where the engraving , drilling and cutting operation to be performed and set the X,Y,Z value.
6. Change the spindle to PC mode and set manual mode X,Y,Z value in the PC.Go to offset,select G54, set the value and save work offset
7. Load the Auto level Engrave file by selecting the option File/Load.
8. Place the tool bits in the proper tool bit location.
9. Select Refer all home and select Cycle start
10. Connect the magnet above the PCB board and connect the probe in the tool bit and check the level of the board.
11. Press cycle start. Engraving process will start and completed based on the design
12. Load the Drill file and press the cycle start.
13. After completting drill operation Load Cut file and press the cycle start for cutting operation
14. Remove the board from the PCB mate machine after the cutting process is completed.
15. Masking process - Apply the ink on the board and place the OHP sheet above the ink.
16. Place it on the UV masking machine for 1 min 25 sec to develop the bare board. 
## Theory
Mach3 Mill is a popular software used for controlling CNC (Computer Numerical Control) milling machines. It's commonly employed in various manufacturing processes, including PCB (Printed Circuit Board) fabrication. Here's an overview of Mach3 Mill software in the context of PCB engraving, drilling, and cutting:
### Purpose:
Mach3 Mill software serves as a control interface for CNC milling machines, enabling users to:</br>
Engrave: Create intricate designs, patterns, or labels on PCB surfaces.</br>
Drill: Precisely drill holes for component placement and interconnects on PCBs.</br>
Cut: Mill out PCB outlines, remove excess material, and separate individual boards from larger panels.</br>
## Functionality:
### G-code Interpretation: 
Mach3 Mill interprets G-code instructions generated by CAD/CAM software and translates them into motion commands for the CNC machine's stepper motors or servo motors.
### Motion Control: 
The software provides control over multiple axes (X, Y, and Z) of the CNC machine, allowing for precise movement and positioning of the milling tool.
### Toolpath Generation:
Mach3 Mill generates toolpaths based on the input G-code, specifying the exact movements and cutting parameters required for engraving, drilling, or cutting operations.
### Spindle Control: 
It manages the rotation speed and direction of the spindle or milling tool, ensuring optimal cutting performance and tool life.
### Simulation: 
Some versions of Mach3 Mill offer simulation capabilities, allowing users to preview toolpaths and visualize the machining process before actually running the CNC machine.
## Benefits:
### Precision: 
Mach3 Mill enables highly precise control over the CNC machine's movements, resulting in accurate engraving, drilling, and cutting operations on PCBs.
### Versatility: 
The software supports a wide range of machining tasks, making it suitable for various PCB fabrication processes, from prototyping to production.
### Customization:
Users can customize cutting parameters, toolpaths, and other settings to optimize performance and achieve desired results for specific PCB designs.
### Integration:
Mach3 Mill integrates seamlessly with CAD/CAM software, allowing for efficient design-to-manufacturing workflows and easy generation of G-code for PCB machining.
### Compatibility:
Mach3 Mill is compatible with a wide range of CNC milling machines, including routers and engravers commonly used in PCB manufacturing. It runs on Windows-based computers and interfaces with CNC hardware through parallel port or USB connections.
## Implementation:
Implementing Mach3 Mill involves installing the software on a compatible computer, configuring it to communicate with the CNC machine, and setting up parameters for the specific machining tasks required for PCB fabrication. Operators typically undergo training to familiarize themselves with the software's features and operation.
### Considerations:
License: Mach3 Mill may require purchasing a license for full functionality, depending on the version and usage requirements.
System Requirements: Ensure that your computer meets the minimum system requirements specified by Mach3 Mill for optimal performance.
Safety: Follow proper safety protocols and guidelines when operating CNC machines to prevent accidents and ensure operator safety.
Overall, Mach3 Mill software provides powerful capabilities for PCB engraving, drilling, and cutting, enabling manufacturers to achieve precise and efficient PCB fabrication processes.
## Result
Thus the engraving,drilling, cutting and masking operation are performed to develop the bare board.
